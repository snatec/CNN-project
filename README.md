Detect the presence of pneumonia using chest x-ray images

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid. The infection can be life-threatening to anyone, but particularly to infants, children and people over 65. Pneumonia can prevent your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.


In this Project a CNN model is created that can classify chest X-Ray images as a Pneumonia case or a Normal case.Training a model reduces human errors and time,as it can take a lot of time to check thousands of images real time.

Steps followed:

-Dealing with Image data sets.

-Performing Data Processing and Augmentation as and when required.

-Creating and training a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow 2.0
